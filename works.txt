            <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/dp/0812968255?tag=dailystoic0b-20 target="_blank"">Meditations</a>
            is perhaps the only document of its kind ever made. It is the private thoughts
            of the world’s most powerful man giving advice to himself on how to make good 
            on the responsibilities and obligations of his positions. Trained in Stoic 
            philosophy, Marcus Aurelius stopped almost every night to practice a series of 
            spiritual exercises—reminders designed to make him humble, patient, empathetic, 
            generous, and strong in the face of whatever he was dealing with. It is 
            imminently readable and perfectly accessible. You cannot read this book and 
            not come away with a phrase or a line that will be helpful to you the next time 
            you are in trouble. Read it, it is practical philosophy embodied. Originally 
            titled, “To Himself,” Meditations is the definitive text on self-discipline, 
            personal ethics, humility, self-actualization, and strength. It proved to be 
            equally inspirational to writers like Ambrose Bierce and Robert Louis Stevenson 
            as he has been for statesmen like Theodore Roosevelt, Wen Jiabao, and Bill 
            Clinton. If you read it and aren’t profoundly changed by it, it’s probably 
            because as Aurelius says “what doesn’t transmit light creates its own 
            darkness.” As John Stuart Mill put it in his On Liberty, Meditations are 
            “the highest ethical product of the ancient mind”.<br>

            It is important to remind ourselves that we are lucky to have access to 
            these. As Gregory Hays explains, for centuries traces of it was lost 
            until the beginning of the 10th century, “it reappears in a letter from 
            the scholar and churchman Arethas.”
