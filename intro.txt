            Marcus Aurelius was a Roman emperor from 161 to 180 and a Stoic philosopher. 
            He was the last of the rulers known as the Five Good Emperors, and the last 
            emperor of the Pax Romana, an age of relative peace and stability for the 
            Roman Empire. He served as Roman consul in 140, 145, and 161. He held one 
            of—if not the most—powerful positions in the world at the time. If he chose 
            to, nothing would be off-limits. He could indulge and succumb to temptations, 
            there was nobody that could restrain him from any of his wishes. However, he 
            governed by absolute power, under the guidance of wisdom and virtue. That’s 
            what separates Marcus from the majority of past and present world leaders. 
            Marcus Aurelius died on March 17, 180. His son Commodus became emperor and soon 
            ended the northern military efforts. Marcus Aurelius, however, is not best 
            remembered for the wars he waged, but for his contemplative nature and his rule 
            driven by reason. A collection of his thoughts has been published in a work 
            called The Meditations. Based on his Stoic beliefs, the work is filled with his 
            notes on life.
